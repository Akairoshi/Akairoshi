## About me
I’m a second-year student majoring in Information Systems and Programming. My main focus is C++ development, but I’m also exploring other technologies. I learn fast, enjoy solving problems, and sometimes dive into 3D modeling as a side interest.

- My long-term goal is to grow into a skilled professional and work in an international environment.
